You can use a loop to execute the ip addr add command for each IP address in the range you specified. Here's a simple way to do it in bash:

bash

#!/bin/bash

# Define the base IP address and network interface
BASE_IP="102.211.235."
INTERFACE="bond0"

# Loop through IP addresses from 1 to 14 and assign them to the interface
for ((i=1; i<=14; i++)); do
    sudo ip addr add $BASE_IP$i dev $INTERFACE
done

Save this script in a file, for example, add_ips.sh, and make it executable with the command:

bash

chmod +x add_ips.sh

Then execute the script:

bash

./add_ips.sh

This will add IP addresses 102.211.235.1 through 102.211.235.14 to the bond0 network interface.
